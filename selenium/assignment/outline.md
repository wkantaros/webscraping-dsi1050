# Web Scraping Homework

## About

The purpose of this assignment is to work with python web scraping tools in an applicable way. To do so, we will be using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) to build a virtual crawler that 1) logs into and scrapes the product names from a given website and 2) searches for that product on ebay and returns it to the user.


### A brief reintroduction to the internet

- discuss internet
- discuss dom
- workout an outline (explain what a browser is, document object model, static vs dynamic styling)
- explain html, css, and js -- dom
- find example of site with and w/o js
- Discuss js rendered vs html rendered content

### Selenium

Selenium was created as a tool to help developers automate testing on the internet. 
- Discuss what selenium does and why its important
- more powerful than other tools (some only render html content)

## Outline

- very high level what will be happening in project

- playing around with inspector
- going through authentication in driver
- going to be searching for lowest price on ebay (on first page)
<!-- - if not yet in database, add to database
- if in database, pull out price of good
- if already in database, report back to user and let know if price  -->
- discuss importance of proxy farms, why we'll be using those

>"Websites are cabaple of tracking your IP information, pages you visit with the same IP, your user agent information, your request frequencies and many other metrics. You can think IP as of your internet identity and any systematic requests sent from the same IP to a website can be easily detected by anti-webscraper tools and you will get IP-banned.
>Our robot should be imitating regular human internet surfing behaviour so that it will not get noticed or cause any suspicion to any website. To make it more clear: Imagine yourself visiting pages of a website while using a free VPN service each time you change the page. Wait for a random amount of time in between two pages and also copy/paste the data from the website."


- cache data to database

# Web Scraping Homework

## About

The purpose of this assignment is to work with python web scraping tools in an applicable way. To do so, we will be using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) to build a virtual crawler that 1) logs into and scrapes the product names from a given website and 2) searches for that product on ebay and returns it to the user.
